# StalenScraper
Simple web scraper used to pull the high resolution images from the talented Simon Stalenhag's website. Please note: He specifically provides these high resolution images as well as instructions to click his images for their higher resolution versions! This project was made before he updated his website to separated each project into its own section on the website. When this was made, every project's images were listed in an incredibly long web page.
